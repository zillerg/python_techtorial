# Create a program that will ask user ten full names
# After you get the ten full name
# Create email version of given ten names
# And store it inside the list and print
# Enter fullname
# John Wick
# enter full name
# Max White

# return -> ["johnwick@gmail.com", "maxwhite@gmail.com"]


# full_names = []
# emails = []

# for i in range(10):
#     print("Enter a full name")
#     f_name = input()
#     full_names.append(f_name)
#     f_name = f_name.replace(" ","").lower()+"gmail.com"
#     emails.append(f_name)

# print(full_names)
# print(emails)



# --------------- My Solution ----------------------------------

# ten_names = 10
# emails = []

# for i in range(ten_names):
#     email_names = ""
#     print("Enter ten full names")
#     enter_name = input()
#     email_names = enter_name.lower().strip().replace(" ","") + "@gmail.com"
#     emails.append(email_names)
# print(emails)
