set = {1,3,10,9,1}
# it removes the last instance of duplicate variable
# it also removes order so it doesn't matter in witch order values are placed

print(set)

#print(set[0])  -> it will give an error

# Set itself is mutable object but we cannot store mutable object in a set

# string, boolean, integer, float -> immutable
# list -> mutable

# it will give error
#set1 = {1,9,3,4,[3,456,6,7]}
